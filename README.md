# SerialMonitor

SerialMonitor is a continuation and fork of a personalised tool I developed for 
[Haemograph Pyt. Ltd.](https://github.com/Haemograph-Rheometer/) to monitor the firmware I was
involved in developing, now enhanced as a more general tool for reading from the Serial Monitor and
recording logs.
